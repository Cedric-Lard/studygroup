# LeetCode Exercises
This is your folder in the LeetCode Exercises section of the repo. This folder will contain LeetCode Challenge solutions that you created. Below is an overview of this folder.

## Folder Structure
Please keep the folder neat and easy to navigate, but this is essentially your space. What I recommend is the following
- **LeetCodeExerciseName/**
    - **Solution01**
        - Contains your solution and notes for Exercise 1 of Module 1 in class.
  
  - **Files:**
  - Files should be uploaded as a py file.
  - Notes can be annotated separately or as comments in the solution file.
    - `solution.py`: Your solution to the exercise.
    - `notes.md`: Notes and explanations related to the exercise.

- **...**
