## Collaboration and Contribution

This repository serves as a central hub for our study group. Members are encouraged to:

- **Upload their own solutions**: Share your code for exercises and challenges to receive feedback and help others learn from your approach.
- **Seek assistance**: If you're stuck on a problem, upload your code, and we can work through the issues together.
- **Review and collaborate**: Provide constructive feedback on your peers' submissions, suggest improvements, and discuss alternative solutions.

## Weekly Meetings

Our study group meets weekly via Google Meet to discuss our progress, address any challenges, and share insights. This repository will serve as a supplement to our meetings, ensuring continuous support and collaboration throughout the week.

## Getting Started



## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### Coding_Exercises

Contains all coding exercises from our class.

- **Completed**: Post your solutions and let's talk about it. It is important to realize that everyone thinks a bit differently and there is technically no "right" answer to coding patterns, conventions, or algorithm usage. Some things work better than others. If you develope a solution that works on your own please share it. It can help you grow to discuss what you did and how you thought of the problem and give us more perspectives.
  - `member_name/`: Subfolder for each member to keep their solutions organized.
    - `exercise_name/`: Specific exercise folder containing the solution files.
      - `solution.py`: The solution file.
      - `notes.md`: Notes and explanations.

- **To_Review**: Exercises that need review and feedback.
  - `member_name/`: Subfolder for each member.
    - `exercise_name/`: Specific exercise folder containing the files needing review.
      - `attempt.py`: The initial attempt at solving the exercise.
      - `notes.md`: Notes and explanations.

### Debug_Challenges

Contains debugging challenges from our class.

- **Completed**: Solutions that have been finalized.
  - `member_name/`: Subfolder for each member to keep their solutions organized.
    - `challenge_name/`: Specific challenge folder containing the solution files.
      - `fixed_bug.py`: The fixed bug solution file.
